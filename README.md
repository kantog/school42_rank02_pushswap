This is the fifth project I did for the Campus 19 Common Core (part of the international 42 Network): sort a stack with a limited number of possible moves, and do it as efficiently as possible.

From the documentation:

_Writing a sorting algorithm is always a very important step in a developer’s journey. It is often the first encounter with the concept of complexity. Sorting algorithms and their complexity are part of the classic questions discussed during job interviews. It’s probably a good time to look at these concepts since you’ll
have to face them at some point. The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C, and use of basic algorithms.Especially focusing on their complexity. Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple. Especially
because from one integers configuration to another, the most efficient sorting solution can differ._

Allowed eternal functions: free, malloc, write, read, exit.

Score: 87/100 + 'outstanding project'
